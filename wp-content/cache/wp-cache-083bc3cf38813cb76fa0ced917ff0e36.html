				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>How web design and development started</h3>
<p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardized code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.</p>
<p>The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Astoundify/portfolio?ref=Astoundify">Web design partially overlaps</a> web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
<h3>The start of the web and web design</h3>
<p>In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. Throughout 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers however the majority of them were Unix-based and were naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphical design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance</li>
<li>GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing</li>
<li>However, because Flash required a plug-in</li>
</ul>
<p>The W3C was created in October 1994, to &#8220;lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability.&#8221; This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications corp. That later became known as <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Astoundify/portfolio?ref=Astoundify">Netscape Communications</a> the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regards to the traditional standards process. For example Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On a whole the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.</p>
<h3>Evolution of web design</h3>
<p>In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique. The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML</p></blockquote>
<p>To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank spacer. GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing. CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout; this allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see tableless web design.</p>
<p>In 1996, Flash (originally known as <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Astoundify/portfolio?ref=Astoundify">FutureSplash</a>) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs and JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share from lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn&#8217;t forego using motion graphics altogether) and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.<sup id="cite_ref-Chapman.2C_Evolution_6-1"><br />
</sup></p>
<h3>End of the first browser wars</h3>
<p>During 1998 Netscape released <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Astoundify/portfolio?ref=Astoundify">Netscape Communicator</a> code under an open source licence, enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software. However, they decided to stop and start from the beginning, which guided the development of the open source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform. The Web Standards Project was formed, and promoted browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards by creating Acid1, Acid2, and Acid3 tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer had been released for Mac, this was significant as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the PNG image format. During this time Netscape was sold to AOL and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.</p>

However, they decided to stop and start from the beginning, which guided the development of the open source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform. The Web Standards Project was formed, and promoted browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards by creating Acid1, Acid2, and Acid3 tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer had been released for Mac, this was significant as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the PNG image format. During this time Netscape was sold to AOL and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.</p>

As the original meaning of <i>awesome</i> has become somewhat antiquated in general use, the term <i><a title="awe-inspiring" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/awe-inspiring">awe-inspiring</a></i> is now generally used for the same meaning.</p>
<div>Although it&#8217;s now used as another word for <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cool">cool</a>, it literally means something that strucks awe. Something so amazing, one is in awe seeing it. But like I said, nowadays it&#8217;s used just like <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cool">cool</a>.</p>
<div></div>
<div>Someone who is absolutely amazing and exhibits the traits of being worthy of awe! Perfection at it&#8217;s greatest. When one is considered to be amazing, it can be inferred that they are also amazing, cool, beautiful, and fantastic.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>How web design and development started</h3>
<p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardized code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.</p>
<p>The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Astoundify/portfolio?ref=Astoundify">Web design partially overlaps</a> web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
<h3>The start of the web and web design</h3>
<p>In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. Throughout 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers however the majority of them were Unix-based and were naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphical design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance</li>
<li>GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing</li>
<li>However, because Flash required a plug-in</li>
</ul>
<p>The W3C was created in October 1994, to &#8220;lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability.&#8221; This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications corp. That later became known as <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Astoundify/portfolio?ref=Astoundify">Netscape Communications</a> the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regards to the traditional standards process. For example Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On a whole the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.</p>
<h3>Evolution of web design</h3>
<p>In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique. The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML</p></blockquote>
<p>To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank spacer. GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing. CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout; this allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see tableless web design.</p>
<p>In 1996, Flash (originally known as <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Astoundify/portfolio?ref=Astoundify">FutureSplash</a>) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs and JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share from lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn&#8217;t forego using motion graphics altogether) and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.<sup id="cite_ref-Chapman.2C_Evolution_6-1"><br />

<h3>End of the first browser wars</h3>
<p>During 1998 Netscape released <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Astoundify/portfolio?ref=Astoundify">Netscape Communicator</a> code under an open source licence, enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>How web design and development started</h3>
<p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardized code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.</p>
<p>The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Astoundify/portfolio?ref=Astoundify">Web design partially overlaps</a> web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
<h3>The start of the web and web design</h3>
<p>In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. Throughout 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers however the majority of them were Unix-based and were naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphical design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance</li>
<li>GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing</li>
<li>However, because Flash required a plug-in</li>
</ul>
<p>The W3C was created in October 1994, to &#8220;lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability.&#8221; This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications corp. That later became known as <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Astoundify/portfolio?ref=Astoundify">Netscape Communications</a> the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regards to the traditional standards process. For example Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML.
